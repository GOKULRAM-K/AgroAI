# 🌿 AI-Powered Plant Disease Detection Web App

## 🚀 Getting Started Guide

1. In `app.py`, load your trained machine learning model (e.g., a `.h5` file).
2. In `index.js`, add your Gemini AI API key (generate one from the Gemini platform).
3. Make sure you have **Node.js**, **npm**, and **Flask** installed on your system.
4. Start the Node server:
   ```bash
   node index.js
   ```
   > 🔹 Ensure your terminal's current working directory is the project folder.
5. Run the Flask app:
   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```
6. Open your browser and go to: [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)

## 🧠 App Usage

- Upload a plant image to the app.
- The trained AI model (built with TensorFlow) will predict the disease.
- The prediction is then sent to **Gemini AI** to generate informative content about the detected disease.
